This is a readme for how the databases will be setup and how the relationships
between all the information will be defined. 

The most information that we will need will be the listed below

please make sure to compile the program with link to library openssl for md5 
"-lssl"

TABLE ONE: 
folder name: string
file name: string
file modification date: date
file upload date: date
file last access: date
file last modified: date 
file delete date: date
file size: size_t
file MD5: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1220046/how-to-get-the-md5-hash-of-a-file-in-c
permissions: (linux UGO)
owner name: 20 chars max. 

create table dbp_file_information (folder_name varchar(256), file_name varchar(256), file_md DATE, file_ud DATE, file_la DATE, file_lm DATE, file_dd DATE, file_size long, file_md5 varchar(32), permission long, owner varchar(32));


MYSQL:

 Application programs should use this general outline for interacting with MySQL:

    Initialize the MySQL client library by calling mysql_library_init().

    Initialize a connection handler by calling mysql_init() and connect to the server by calling mysql_real_connect().

    Issue SQL statements and process their results. (The following discussion provides more information about how to do this.)

    Close the connection to the MySQL server by calling mysql_close().

    End use of the MySQL client library by calling mysql_library_end().
