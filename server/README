DBP - device backup protocol

What is this?
device backup protocol is a protocol designed to backup the device automatically as any changes on 
the client become known. 

How will this work?
on the client end, it is client's responsibility to identify changes. the client can do this however 
they like, the protocol does not defines how the client should handle this processing, the only thing
that this protocol defines is how the server should handle the processing once the request is sent by 
the client. 

on the server end, we will receive protocol packets which you can learn more about in networking/PROTOCOL
we will receive this packet, which will be prepended with a 8 byte header. 
this 8 byte header is read to get all the required information on processing the rest of the data. 
other than this 8 byte header, the rest of the header is human-readable to make processing easier for 
clients, and they would not need any specific processing pattern. 
the only requirement for the protocol is that the very first key:value pair in the header needs to 
reference the key "action" which will tell the program what other key:value pairs to expect, and how 
the rest of the processing should be done.
