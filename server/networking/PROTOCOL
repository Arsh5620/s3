This file will have information about the protocol used for the
communication between the "server" and the "client"

The communication will be packet based over a reliable network
where some assumptions about the underlying transport protocol
are made. 

We assume that the protocol used for transfer of any such "packets"
will be RELIABLE, IN-ORDER, and GAURANTEED. 

For this purpose we will use the most widely used transport protocol
and that will be TCP over IP. TCP/IP. 

We will be using sockets library provided by the operating system
to make use of this protocol. 

** Now we will start discussing in regards of the actual chat protocol

The purpose of networking sub-system is just processing of the "packets"
, it is not our job to process the "packet" and extract any relevant
information. That part will be delegated to a different subsystem. 

There are a few ways we can do this, after reading on the internet, 
and finding some information on stack overflow which I quote 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/769045/when-i-send-a-packet-over-tcp-it-is-split-into-two-packets
, the answer by Jon Skeet explains that the TCP data is sent as a stream
and that we should not make assumptions on how you will receive the
stream on the other end of the communication channel. And that the 
best solution is to prefix the stream with a 32 bit size integer, but 
you should also not assume that the 32 bits will be read at once. 

STATE CYCLE

1. WAITING FOR CONNECT
2. CONNECT
3. WAITING FOR DATA
4. HEADER SENT
5. DATA SENT
6. WAITING FOR MORE
7. EITHER GO TO 3, OR 8
8. CONNECTION END 

Header information required for the protocol.
