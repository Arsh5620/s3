We are just looking to create a very basic lexer, to process 
configuration files and parse them into key value pairs, that
we can use later. 
key value pairs will be in the following format:
key = "value that include spaces"
key = valuethatdoesnotincludespaces
key = 1234

We don't accept hex values or decimals right now, but we might later. 
We will also need to accept comments in the config file along
with multiple empty lines, and a lot of unnecessary spaces. 
We only accept one line comments. 
We only accept double quotes for quoted strings.
