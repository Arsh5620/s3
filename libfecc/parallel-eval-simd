(a0x0 + a8x8) 
+ x(a1x1 + a9x9) 
+ x2(a2x2 + a10x10) 
+ x3(a3x3 + a11x11)

Now in terms of polynomials, polynomial representation is actually reversed so it is (a11x11 + a10x10 + ... + a1x1 + a0x0)
But we are already working on an inverted polynomial which is we have corrected the representation to the one we need for evaluation.
