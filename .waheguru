Reed Solomon Codes:

Reed Solomon codes is a family of codes where every code is characterized by three parameters 
Alphabet size (q), here q is the numbers of different alphabets in the code (such as {0,1} is a binary code with alphabet size of 2), ({0, 1, 2, 3, 4} would be a code with alphabet size of 5). 

Block length (n), block length would be the size of the message itself, such as a message {01111} would be of a block length 5.
